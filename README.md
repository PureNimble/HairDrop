## 1. Description of the Project

This project is a service designed to seamlessly connect users with hair salons, barbershops, and independent hairstylists, offering a modern, on-demand solution for hair care. Through the platform, users can easily browse available hairstylists, select a preferred time and location—whether it's at a salon, barbershop, or their own home—and book appointments for haircuts or other grooming services. Clients can schedule sessions that fit their lifestyle, while hairstylists benefit from a streamlined system for managing bookings, locations, and payments. This creates a user-friendly experience for both customers and professionals alike.
